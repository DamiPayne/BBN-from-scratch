# BBN-from-scratch
A guide on how to build a neural net in python with numpy.
I have included detailed step by step explanations for every step.

We generate a set of random binary numbers and use neural nets to make an exclusive or (XOR) prediction.
You can play around with the number of hidden layers, learning rates  and epochs(cycles) to look at the effect that these changes have on the result.

Hopefully this provides a great opportunity to understand some of the basic concepts involved in machine learning.
